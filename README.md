# ReactResponsiveTable
A React component for rendering a responsive table

### Under Construction!
Between gigs and hunkered down in these Covid-19 times, I'm working on a personal MERN project. I need a responsive table that switches from a "conventional" table layout to a "columnar" layout.

The conventional layout displays a matrix comprising a header with cell labels, folowed by zero or more rows each displaing the cell vcalue. The columnar displays each object as a vertically aligned set of label-value pairs.

Nowhere near finished. Stay tuned.

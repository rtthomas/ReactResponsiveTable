## ReactResponsiveTable
A React component for rendering a responsive table

### Rationale
I haven't found a simple React table component that displays a table responsively in these formats:
- the conventional header row followed by with content rows, or
- on small screens, in "columnar" form, displaying the data as successive groups of label/value pairs  

Most of the components I've found so far just add horizontal scrollbars

### Usage
Just copy the responsiveTable.js file into your project. All required styling including the responsive transition is implemented with React Styled Components

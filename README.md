# ReactResponsiveTable
A React component for rendering a responsive table

### This is a Work in Progress
Between gigs and hunkered down in these Covid-19 times, I'm working on a personal MERN project. I need a React component implementing a responsive table that switches from a "conventional" table layout to a "columnar" layout.

The conventional layout displays a matrix comprising a header with cell labels, folowed by zero or more rows each displaing the cell vcalue. The columnar displays each object as a vertically aligned set of label-value pairs.

I thought there must be lots of solutions out there, but I haven't found them. So I'm working on this one. Thanks to Thiru from whose codepen example https://codepen.io/Thiru/pen/bmxvZK I adapted the responsive styling.

Nowhere near finished. Stay tuned.
